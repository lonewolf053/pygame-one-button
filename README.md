Mushroom jumper: A cool Pygame based on the concept of flappy bird.

It uses the pygame library.
You can install the pygame library with :
pip install pygame

The concept of the game is simple. 
You just need to press space key to make the mushroom work and avoid hitting the mushroom with the rectangular yellow bars :).
When you hit the bar, it is game over :( 

Do try out the game, it will be fun ;)
